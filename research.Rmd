My research focuses on **evaluating** and **applying** advanced statistical methods to behavioral data. My research falls into two broad categories: quantitative research and applied research.

## Quantitative research

### **Generalized linear model (GLiM)** 

GLiMs are a broad family of statistical models that extend linear regression analysis to a wider range of outcome variable distributions and error structures. I use *simulations* to explore the performance of these models. I am particularly interested in the statistical characteristics of counts outcome variables, especially in statistical mediation models.

### **Integrative data analysis (IDA)** 

I am joint co-PI on [TIDAL](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02734-6), an integrative data analysis project funded by [NIMH](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9509965) combining data from 4 separate psychosocial interventions for teens who have been diagnosed with ADHD. The combined dataset is publicly available [here](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=tidal01). Among the methodological challenges in this project were harmonization of measures of ADHD symptoms (DSM-IV versus DSM-5) and parent depression symptoms (various measures) using moderated nonlinear factor analysis.

### **Statistical graphics and R shiny** 

I am interested in graphics as an aid to interpreting and communicating statistical models. To this end, I have developed `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")` **shiny** applications to calculate effect size for count regression models and mediation models. `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")` **shiny** applications are **interactive, web-based** tools for statistical analysis and graphics.

- [RcountD](https://stefany.shinyapps.io/RcountD/): Estimate effect sizes for regression models for count models (Poisson regression and negative binomial regression). Standard multiplicative effect size (rate ratio) and standardized mean difference (Cohen's *d*) effect sizes are provided. Monte Carlo confidence intervals for each effect size are also given.

- [SimpleMediation](https://stefany.shinyapps.io/SimpleMediation/): Estimate indirect (mediated) effect with Monte Carlo simulated confidence intervals. This app was developed for pedagogical purposes.

- I teach a course on **Statistical Graphics and Communication** in the Psychology department. This course covers a variety of topics, including **R**, **ggplot**, **markdown**, and **shiny**. Most of the materials for the *first version* of the course from 2019 are available here: [https://stefanycoxe.github.io/graphics_2019/](https://stefanycoxe.github.io/graphics_2019/)

## Applied research 

My applied research takes place largely in the context of clinical and psychosocial interventions. I am affiliated with the Center for Children and Families (CCF) at Florida International University, where I help evaluate aspects of the Summer Treatment Program (STP) for children and adolescents with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), interventions to improve infant and toddler mental health, and child mental health adjustment following traumatic events. These studies include complex longitudinal designs, non-normally distributed outcome variables, and extensive missing data. Previously, I worked at the Prevention Research Center (PRC) at Arizona State University on longitudinal and prospective evaluations of interventions for bereaved children and Mexican-American adolescents, including psychometric analysis of study measures, longitudinal growth models, multilevel regression, and multilevel structural equation models.
